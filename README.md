# CRUD API Project - ASP.NET Core with SQL Server

This project demonstrates a simple yet powerful ***CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)*** API built with ***ASP.NET Core*** and connected to a ***SQL Server*** database. It exposes a ***RESTful API*** to manage student data and performs basic CRUD operations. The API uses ***Entity Framework Core (EF Core)*** for ORM (Object Relational Mapping) to interact with the database and supports robust querying capabilities.

The API follows modern development practices and is designed to scale effectively in a production environment, providing a strong foundation for more complex applications. Additionally, it features a JavaScript front-end to consume the API, making it a full-stack solution.

## Features
* ***Create***: Adds a new student record to the database.
* ***Read***: Retrieve all students or specific student by ID.
* ***Update***: Modify existing student records.
* ***Delete***: Remove a student record from the database.

 ## Technologies Used
* ***ASP.NET Core***: A modern, high-performance framework used for building RESTful APIs with scalable and maintainable architecture.
* ***Entity Framework Core (EF Core)***: An ORM for data access that enables a smooth integration with SQL Server.
* ***SQL Server***: The relational database management system used for storing student data.
* ***Swagger/OpenAPI***: Used for generating API documentation and testing endpoints in an interactive interface.
* ***CORS***: Configured to handle cross-origin requests, enabling communication between the front-end and back-end, especially in separated development environments.
* ***JavaScript Front-End***: A simple JavaScript application (or integration) to interact with the API, demonstrating the client-side interaction with the API.
