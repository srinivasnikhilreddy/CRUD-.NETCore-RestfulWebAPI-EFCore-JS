CRUD API Project - ASP.NET Core with SQL Server
This project demonstrates a simple yet powerful CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API built with ASP.NET Core and connected to a SQL Server database. It exposes a RESTful API to manage student data and performs basic CRUD operations. The API uses Entity Framework Core (EF Core) for ORM (Object Relational Mapping) to interact with the database and supports robust querying capabilities.

The API follows modern development practices and is designed to scale effectively in a production environment, providing a strong foundation for more complex applications. Additionally, it features a JavaScript front-end to consume the API, making it a full-stack solution.
